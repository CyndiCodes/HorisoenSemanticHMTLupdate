updated html to include semantic html elements including header, main (with sections), aside (with sections), and footer and updated css to reply. also updated heading to fall in sequential order (h1-h4) in html and updated h4 in css footer to reply. Added unique title to website.
p {} element in css removed. was set to 16px font size which is as an auto setting for <p> so removing could clean up the code. 
break in nav code corrected for nav element for "seach engine optimization" feature in html
